By default, I want to see the board after each transformaton is applied, and I want
to be told what the transformation was.

I want to also have a batch mode where all this stuff is still printed, but the
program ddoesn't wait for me between each transform.

I also want a batch mode where I just get the solution (but it tells me if it had
to use backtracking.

I want it to read stdin if there is no input file.

Eventually, I would like it to generate puzzles, and reject those harder than a
certain level.  It should categorize them according to how hard they are.
